      <p>
        I was first introduced to coding in 2022, when NFT's were at their peak.
        I dabbled in the crypto space for a couple months until my friend asked
        me whether I wanted to help him run up a couple NFT projects.
        Unfortunately I had no skills that could have been of help, so I had to
        learn something.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I decided to go with web development as every NFT project needed a
        website and I thought it couldn't be too hard to put some text on a
        page. So I went ahead an learned HTML, CSS, javascript and Solidity
        (smart contracts on Ethereum)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Unfortunately once I reached an acceptable level of competence, NFT's
        had crashed and I wasn't able to make anything worthwhile.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Skip forward until after graduation, I decided to apply for a finance
        program but due to lack of housing in the netherlands at the time, I
        wasn't able to find an affordable place to live. So I was forced to take
        a gap year.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        During this gap year I decided it would be a good idea to use my free
        time to learn something, so I chose to stick with programming and
        develop my skills gradually over the next couple of months.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I eventually ended up getting into a finance course(International
        Finance & Control), but it was falsely advertised and my dream (not
        really) of becoming an investment banker was crushed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I had to do something else with my life so I decided to pursue ICT
        (because comp sci was too much math). Which leads me to today.
